<p class="lead">My work focuses on <strong>computational hemodynamics</strong> in the pulmonary circulation: coupling 3D CFD with 0D/1D LPN models, structured-tree microvascular boundary conditions, and <em>microvascular adaptation</em> models for predictive surgery planning.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pulmonary circulation modeling and waveform fidelity</li>
  <li>Structured-tree outflow boundary conditions and impedance tuning</li>
  <li>Adaptive radius/thickness models under shear and transmural stress</li>
  <li>Coupling svZeroDSolver with svMultiPhysics (SimVascular)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Patient-specific 3D CFD with RANS/transient solvers</li>
  <li>Closed-loop LPN circulations with RCR and structured trees</li>
  <li>Sensitivity analyses, parameter sweeps, uncertainty quantification</li>
</ul>
