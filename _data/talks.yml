  abstract: "We present a comparative study of pulmonary hemodynamics in a sheep model of the Fontan circulation versus a healthy control, using patient-specific 3D simulations and a novel boundary condition tuning approach. The Fontan procedure, which reroutes systemic venous return directly to the pulmonary arteries without a subpulmonary ventricle, creates non-physiological flow conditions that can impact vascular health. Using 4D-flow MRI data and SimVascular’s open-source tools, we generated CFD models with structured-tree outflow boundary conditions tuned to match catheter-measured pressures and flow splits. Results showed that the Fontan sheep exhibited lower inflow pulsatility, reduced microvascular stiffness, and a smaller outlet tree root diameter compared to the control, while wall shear stress remained similar. These findings suggest adaptive vascular remodeling in response to altered hemodynamics, potentially preserving homeostatic shear despite Fontan-induced flow disruption."

  abstract: "We present a novel boundary condition framework to improve virtual treatment planning for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis by enabling more accurate post-operative hemodynamic predictions. Using patient-specific CFD and reduced-order models, we simulate microvascular adaptation to surgical or transcatheter intervention by constructing structured trees from 3D model outlets down to capillary-scale vessels. These trees are optimized to match clinical pre-operative pressure and flow data, then adapted based on mechanobiological stimuli—wall shear stress and intramural stress—that drive vessel remodeling. This approach captures physiologic changes in microvascular resistance after intervention and advances predictive modeling for surgical planning."

- title: "Multi-Fidelity Simulations of Microvascular Adaptation After Virtual Transcatheter Intervention"

  type: "Talk"
  event: "8th International Conference on Computational and Mathematical Biomedical Engineering"
  location: "Arlington, VA, USA"
  date: "2024-06-24"
  abstract: "Virtual treatment planning is necessary to reduce the instance of unwarranted and unsuccessful transcatheter intervention in patients with complex pulmonary vascular disease. In order to make accurate predictions of interventional outcomes, adaptation of vessels outside of the simulation domain must be considered. In this work, we present a software package in the Simvascular solver suite capable of computing microvascular adaptation according to the constant wall shear stress hypothesis, enabling treatment planning in 0D and 3D patient-specific models. This allows for easy implementation of virtual surgical planning methods and takes a step towards uncertainty-aware treatment planning."
